# Data-Analysis-of-NYC-cab-rides
This is a basic data analysis project made using Python. The library used is NumPy. Here we have used data set fetched from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zu1xLzjcRKgWJ-B2k1j4BdMVFutkiqic/view.  

Our data set contains pickup year, month, time, pickup location, drop off location, distance between the locations, time taken and the fares and tips of the rides.  

Using this data we will answer a few questions like 
* Mean speed of our cab rides. 
* Rides in a particular month 
* No. of times where drivers were tipped over a certain amount 
* Months where drivers were tipped this amount 
* No. of times riders were dropped off to the airport.

The project is made in jupyter notebook. 

## Where to go from here?
We can extend this project by finding :
* Busiest month for cab drivers
* Most tipped routes
* Least tipped routes
* Longest time taken in a ride
* Shortest time taken to reach the destination

We can also show a visual representation of the findings through libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. Once done with this dataset, we can also extend this to any other city in USA or any part of the world.
